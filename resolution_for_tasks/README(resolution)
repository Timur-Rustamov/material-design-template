To complete ---2nd task--- we use the script "installing_packets.sh"
---In 3rd task--- we make a fork through UI of github, than execute git clone git@github.com:Timur-Rustamov/material-design-template.git . After it we generate ssh-keygen and configuring ssh authentication between github and our server.
---the 4th and 5th tasks--- i decided to do with script. Script named "pulling_from_git.sh" .cron config is on "Screenshot 2021-10-08 at 16.35.27.png". Also i have attached nginx config with the same name(i have changed the path for it's root directory). Also i thought of another variant, where we can add a comand to copy index.html from local git repo to the default nginx root dir.
while doing tasks i forgot to all changes in feature branch and did all commits in the main. to create another branch we can use 'git checkout -b feature', then after all changes we go to main branch and execute 'git merge/rebase feature' to unit branches. 
---The last task---intead of merging feature branch and main i merged local main and remote by command git pull origin(i did some changes in web version of github). then to rebase my tree and squash my commits i used the comman 'git rebase -i --root', there i changed "pick" to "s" to squash some commits. then save this file and in the next just aprove changes about the seq of commits in final.
